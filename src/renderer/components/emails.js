I know this proposal letter will be a pleasant surprise to you as we don't know ourselves before. I am from Republic of South Sudan, now seeking asylum in Dakar Senegal. I contacted you because of my serious search for a reliable and trust worthy person that can handle a confidential transaction like this. I will like you to help me transfer this amount (US$3.4Million) Three Million Four Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars to your account.

If you are interested, you should reply me quickly to enable me give you full details about the deposit and our way forward to transfer the money to your account.

I am eagerly expecting your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,

Mariam`

I have finish the clearance with the San Anthonio Int'l Airport TX custom and it is compulsory that I will deliver your package and the HOME LAND SECURITY have also inspected the $7.2 million us dollars consignment boxes and the way they inspected it was not please because they demanded for one thing after another which I offered them all because I came with every document that covers your $7.2 million us dollars consignment boxes.
As they have inspected your package and found out that there is no form of deformity in it they now requested that you will send them your OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATE, according to them it will certify that you are the owner of the package and I ask them the reason for that and one of them told me that it is supposed you have your ownership certificate as the package was brought by ECOWAS then they now listened to me and led me to the BENIN REPUBLIC EMBASSY and with the help of Sir. Robert Daniel they agreed to let you obtain the certificate and they said it must come from Benin Rep, the country of origin of the package

Please I am not earlier told of this certificate because we only pay $750:00 for the clearance fee but they newly approved this. As I contacted Director Pastor,Ayo Frank he said that getting the certificate was not a very big problem for him but it will cost you only $98.00 which after that he will fax the certificate to me with this fax to them immediately and I will be at your Address with your consignment boxes. Please you have to know that I have limited time here as I want to meet up with the flight scheduled so you have to send him the money on time so that he will be able to obtain the certificate on time and fax it today.

I wish to give you the best of my service by protecting your package and to make sure that I delivered your package safely, And send the fee to our companyâ€™s cashier name, then Pastor.Ayo Frank will do his best to get me the certificate needed for the delivery today or tomorrow.

So go now to any available Western Union Or money Gram to make the payment for them to cash it up today and get the needed certificate the same today Okay.

I'm sick of your excuses Igor. You need to get your act together and bring me more
appropriate test subjects. The party at Synergy Mill should prove perfect if you don't screw it up.

I'm sure that I don't need to remind you what will happen to your family if you continue
to displease me.

Evil Scientist
